# 🎉 New Year Countdown

This project is a small passion build to celebrate the arrival of the New Year.  
It shows a live countdown to midnight on January 1st, and when the clock strikes 12, the site comes alive with fireworks, snowfall, and a smooth year‑digit animation (2025 → 2026).  

I wanted something playful and festive that feels like a digital celebration — so I mixed together HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make it happen.

## ✨ What it does
- **Countdown Timer**: counts down to January 1st at midnight.
- **Year Animation**: the last digit scrolls up and the new digit slides in.
- **Fireworks**: a colorful show that runs for 60 seconds starting exactly at midnight.
- **Snowfall**: light, subtle snowflakes that respond to device tilt.
- **Easter Egg**: press `Ctrl + Shift + D` to reveal a hidden footer credit.
